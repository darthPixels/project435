Workers were on top of a pier, about 100 feet up, installing rebar for the pier cap. A mobile crane was hoisting and repositioning rebar bundles while some workers installed and tied the rebar into the mat for the pier cap. A bundle of about 30 pieces of rebar (size 20M, with 180-degree "candy cane" hooks on one end) was rigged to be hoisted. As the crane hoisted the bundle, the hook ends became entangled with a loose piece of the same kind of rebar, whose no-hook end (tail end) was lodged in the mat. When the hoisted bundle was about 4 feet off the working surface, the tail end dislodged from the mat and the loose piece struck a nearby worker.

Date of Incident: 2023-Nov

A mobile crane was hoisting a bucket of concrete slurry to a wall form. The location of the form meant the crane boom had to be fully extended. The bucket, which weighed about 2,700 pounds, exceeded the load limit for the fully extended crane boom. The crane base tipped forward while pivoting on the front outrigger set and the operator had to cease lowering the bucket. Concrete-placing workers on the scaffolding below the concrete bucket were instructed to immediately vacate the scaffolding. Before doing so, one of the workers emptied the bucket. The concrete bucket rapidly elevated about 10 feet and then fell back down, contacting the top of the wall formwork and shock-loading the load line. Emptying the bucket also allowed the tipped-over crane to self-right, and it rapidly fell about 6 feet back down onto the rear outriggers, shock-loading the outriggers, boom, and the load line again. Once the boom was retracted, the crane was repositioned off the public roadway and taken out of service.

A worker was loading a mini-excavator onto a dual-axle dump trailer attached to a heavy-duty pickup truck parked on a downhill slope. When the excavator climbed up the ramp to the trailer, the weight of the excavator pushed down on the back of the trailer. This created enough upward force on the trailer hitch of the truck to lift its rear wheels, causing them to lose traction. The emergency brake of the truck was on but without traction of the wheels to the ground, the truck and trailer began moving forward. The worker removed their seat belt and jumped from the excavator. The truck, trailer, and excavator combination continued downhill, jackknifed, and crashed into a parked car.

A worker was using a rubber-tired loader to clean up wood debris. When the loader reversed, it struck a wooden utility pole, causing the centre line of a 3 phase, 13 kV power line to break. The broken, energized line fell onto a rubber-tired crane parked 150 feet away (not in use), next to another utility pole. The transformer ground fault disconnect did not function and the energized electrical line started a fire when it grounded and arced to the crane. The fire completely destroyed the crane and the adjacent wood utility pole. The loader operator was able to move the loader away from the non-energized side of the severed electrical line to a safe area. No injuries were reported.
