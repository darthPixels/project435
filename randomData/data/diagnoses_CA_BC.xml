		<IncidentDescription>A worker was loading a mini-excavator onto a dual-axle dump trailer attached to a heavy-duty pickup truck parked on a downhill slope. When the excavator climbed up the ramp to the trailer, the weight of the excavator pushed down on the back of the trailer.

The emergency brake of the truck was on but without traction of the wheels to the ground, the truck and trailer began moving forward. The worker removed their seat belt and jumped from the excavator.
